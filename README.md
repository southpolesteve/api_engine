[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/southpolesteve/api.png)](https://travis-ci.org/southpolesteve/api)

An API engine for Rails. Convention over configuration. Auto generated docs (coming soon!)

Not ready for public consumption. Massive security holes still exist

## Installation

Add `gem 'api', github: "southpolesteve/api"` to your gem file. That should work. I think. I haven't tested it yet.

## Configuration

There is no configuration... yet. All of your models will be exposed in a REST API at `/api/:model_name`. This is probably a massive security risk for any non-trivial application. You have been warned

## Contributing

Creating an issue is good. Sending a pull request is better.
